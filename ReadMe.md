## 3. Settings Page

This page, accessed through the **PWD Theme Options** menu, will allow a user to add their google analytics code, an image for the login page, and a favicon.

All three will be added to their proper locations.

*source(s): /pages/settings.php, /pages/functions/settings-functions.php*

## 4. Instructional Videos

This page, accessed through the **PWD Theme Options** menu, will display videos from the PWD youtube channel. All of the videos are pulled in dynamically from the channel so there should be no need to update this section.

*source(s): /pages/videos.php, /partials/video-partial.php*

____________________________________________________

## 5. Image Sizes

This page, accessed through the **PWD Theme Options** menu, will display a message with the optimal image sizes for each one. **Please note, THIS WILL NOT CREATE AN IMAGE SIZE FOR YOU. This is only meant to allow a client to see what the optimal upload size is.**

*source(s): /pages/image-sizes.php, /pages/functions/image-sizes-functions.php*

____________________________________________________

## 5. Custom CSS

This page, accessed through the **PWD Theme Options** menu, will allow you to make edits safely to your live css files. It will be added to the head and will override any styles asside from inline styles.

*source(s): /pages/custom-css.php, /pages/functions/custom-css-functions.php*

_____________________________________________________

## 6. Custom Post Types

This page, accessed through the **PWD Theme Options** menu, will allow you to make custom post types for your wordpress site. Note that this will not display any post types created by any other means and it may break if you add a second post type with the same slug!

*source(s): /pages/cpt.php, /pages/functions/cpt-functions.php*
_____________________________________________________

## 7. Maintenance Mode

This page, accessed through the **PWD Theme Options** menu, it creates a maintenance mode page to be displayed to non logged in users. It can be added without any dependence on a specific theme. It does, however, rely on a Ninja Forms form to be created. An ID for this form can be placed in the Ninja Form ID field.

*source(s): /pages/maintenance-mode.php, /pages/functions/maintenance-mode-functions.php, /maintenance.css*

_____________________________________________________

## 8. Client User Type

This is a user type created to show the client the site behind the maintenance mode form. They have no capabilities and cannot even view the admin bar when logged in. In order to add capabilities to that user, either switch them to another user type, or use the add_cap function. Information on how to do this can be found here: [https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_cap](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_cap)

*source(s): /modules/add-client-user.php*

## 9. Dynamic Excerpt Lengths - pwd_excerpt($Character_Count, $Ending)

This function will display a custom excerpt length of the queried post. It also includes an option of adding your own custom ending. The default is " ...".
